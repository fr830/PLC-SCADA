# PLC-SCADA INTERFACING APPLICATION 
## Problem Statement :
To develop SCADA software to control all the feeders through PC and display the parameters in graphical format.
	
## Introduction :
1. PLC: (Programmable Logic Controller) PLC is used for automation of various electro-mechanical processes in industries.
2. PLC  is a purpose-built machine control computer designed to read digital and analog inputs from various sensors.
3. It executes a user defined logic program, and writes the resulting digital and analog output values to various output elements.
4. SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is a control system architecture which controls PLC using computers, network data communication and graphical user interface.
5. PLC and SCADA system will monitor, store and retrieve information from the database and based on its program, it will access electrical power system remotely.
6. It will provide GUI to control the system.
	
## Objective : 
1. To fetch and monitor parameters of each feeders from PC.
2. To design an application and database for PLC SCADA system.
3. To develop desktop application to control the MCBâ€™s.
4. To show the Historical trend of some time span and store data in text file as well.
  
## Methodology :
1. Transfer data in PLC and pc using serial communication in java.
2. Store timestamped data from PLC into database. 
3. Create GUI to control the PLC easily from remote system.

## Applications :
1. Remotely controlling the electrical feeders of Walchand College Of Engineering,Sangli.
2. Keeps track of different current, voltage values through feeders and alerting if any unusual output.
3. Graphical representation of the data available in database.
4. Provides GUI for monitoring electrical supply to feeders.
